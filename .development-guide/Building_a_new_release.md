## Building a new release

To build a new release make sure your on the `main` branch and in sync with **origin**.

Run the PowerShell script `Build-Release.ps1` located in the `Install` directory:

```powershell
./Install/Build-Release.ps1
```

The installation package should be found in the release folder.
