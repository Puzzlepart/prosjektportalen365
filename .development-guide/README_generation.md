## README generation

READMEs are automatically generated using [@appnest/readme](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme). The main README is generated from [.README](../.README) while this README is generated from [.README](.README). The generation is configured with the `blueprint.json` files.

For the main [README.md)[../README.md] generation, the different parts are included from the [readme](../readme) folder at root level.
