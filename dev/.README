## Site Design / Site Scripts

Everything related to the site design and the corresponding site scripts reside in the folder **SiteScripts**. 

The source files are found in the **src** folder.

## JS Provisioning Template

Not everything we want to do is available with site designs, so we're also using [sp-js-provisioning](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/sp-js-provisioning). Please note that weÂ´re using the Puzzlepart fork from **pnp**.

With our PnP content templates (see **3.2.2**) we're provisioning a default template. The default templates for our supported languages are built from the source file [_JsonTemplate.json](../Templates/_JsonTemplate.json).

Please note the **Parameters** object.

```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "ProvisionSiteFields": "Kolonner for Prosjektportalen (Prosjekt)",
    "ProjectContentTypeId": "0x0100805E9E4FEAAB4F0EABAB2600D30DB70C",
    "ProjectStatusContentTypeId": "0x010022252E35737A413FB56A1BA53862F6D5"
  }
}
```

| Parameter                  | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ProvisionSiteFields        | The site fields in this group will be copied to the project site during provisioning. |
| ProjectContentTypeId       | Content type ID for the Project properties content type      |
| ProjectStatusContentTypeId | Content type ID for the Project status content type          |



In addition to the parameters specified in [Standardmal.txt](../Templates/Portfolio/Prosjektmaler/Standardmal.txt), there's also the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TermSetIds | An map of term set fields and term set id. Used to override the default term set ids. |

Say you'd like to use the term set with ID **54da9f47-c64e-4a26-80f3-4d3c3fa1b7b2** for project phase. The internal field name for project phase is **GtProjectPhase**. With the default template, the **Parameters** object would look like this:


```json
{
  "Parameters": {
    "ProvisionSiteFields": "Kolonner for Prosjektportalen (Prosjekt)",
    "ProjectContentTypeId": "0x0100805E9E4FEAAB4F0EABAB2600D30DB70C",
    "ProjectStatusContentTypeId": "0x010022252E35737A413FB56A1BA53862F6D5",
    "TermSetIds": {
      "GtProjectPhase": "54da9f47-c64e-4a26-80f3-4d3c3fa1b7b2"
    }
  }
}
```



## Templates

### JSON provisioning template

At the root level of the **Templates** folder, the following files are found:

| File/Folder                     | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Clean-Resx.ps1`                | Script to remove unused **.resx** resources                  |
| `Find-FieldUsage.ps1`           | Script to find field usage                                   |
| `Get-ComponentProperties.ps1`   | Script to get component properties from `<pnp:ClientSidePage>` instances |
| `Encode-JSON.ps1`               | Script to take the content of a JSON file, encode and minfiy at, and store it in a `.txt`file |
| `Search-Resx.ps1`               | Script to search for unused **.resx** resources              |
| `tasks/generateResxJson.js`     | Node script to generate a JSON representation of the **.resx** files |
| `tasks/generateJsonTemplate.js` | Node script to generate JSON templates for each language     |
| `_JsonTemplate.json`            | JSON project template                                        |

#### Building JSON templates

When doing changes to the JSON template the npm task `watch` can be used. This watches `_JsonTemplate.json` and builds localized version of this to the corresponding Content template.

Resources from the **.resx** files in the folder Portfolio can be used in the template using `{{tokens}}`.

**Example:**

```json
{
    "ID": "0x0100A87AE71CBF2643A6BC9D0948BD2EE897",
    "Name": "{{ContentTypes_Uncertainty_Name}}",
    "Description": "",
    "Group": "{{ContentTypes_Group}}"
}
```



### PnP templates

In addition we have two PnP provisioning templates. 

| Template                            | Description      |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| [Portfolio](../Templates/Portfolio) | Portfolio assets |
| [Taxonomy](../Templates/Taxonomy)   | Taxonomy         |

#### Portfolio

| File/Folder        | Description                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Objects            | PnP assets. See https://github.com/pnp/PnP-Provisioning-Schema |
| SiteAssets         | Files to be uploaded to SiteAssets                           |
| Portfolio.xml      | Main template file                                           |
| `Resources.*.resx` | Resource files                                               |

#### Content templates

Content templates are found in the **Content** folder. The name of the template follows the following pattern:

`Portfolio_content.{language_code}.xml`

`language_code` can be for example **no-NB** or **en-US**.

The templates contains the JSON template(s), planner tasks and phase checklist items.

## NPM

The SharePoint Framework solutions are published to `npm` independently.

- [@Shared](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pp365-shared)
- [ProjectWebParts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pp365-projectwebparts)
- [ProjectExtensions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pp365-projectextensions)
- [PortfolioWebParts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pp365-portfoliowebparts)

## Building a new release

To build a new release make sure your on the `main`branch and in sync with **origin**.

Run the npm script `build:release`:

```shelll
npm run build:release
```

The installation package should be found in the release folder.

## Continuous integration

![CI - Build and install (dev)](https://github.com/Puzzlepart/prosjektportalen365/workflows/CI%20-%20Build%20and%20install%20(dev)/badge.svg?branch=dev)

We have set up continuous using GitHub actions.

### Build and install (dev)

[ci-build-install-dev](../.github/workflows/ci-dev.yml) builds a new release on _push_ to **dev**.

It runs [Build-Release.ps1](../Install/Build-Release.ps1) with `-CI` param, then runs [Install.ps1](../Install/Install.ps1) (also with `-CI` param, this time with a encoded string consisting of the username and password, stored in a GitHub secret). The URL to install to is stored in the GitHub secret `CI_DEV_TARGET_URL`.

With the current approach, with no cache, a full run takes about 30 minutes.

### Build release (main)

[build-release](../.github/workflows/build-release.yml) builds a new release package on _tag_ to **main**, then drafts a new GitHub release with the installation package.

## Creating a new release

For creating a new release, we have two options: Minor and patch. New minor version should be created when there is new functionality of interest to users, while patch versions can be created often with bug fixes, adjustments and minimal functional improvements.

Increasing the version number is done by npm scripts. This is done on the dev-branch when the functionality currently in dev is deemed ready for release. To create a new patch-release:

```shelll
npm version patch
git push --tags
```

Then create a Pull Request to merge dev into main. The output from GitHub Actions will include a release package that can be shared as a release on GitHub. No manual build required.

## README generation
READMEs are automatically generated using [@appnest/readme](https://github.com/andreasbm/readme). The main README is generated from [.README](../.README) while this README is generated from [.README](.README). The generation is configured with the `blueprint.json` files.

For the main [README.md)[../README.md] generation, the different parts are included from the [readme](../readme) folder at root level.
